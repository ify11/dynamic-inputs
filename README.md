# This project demonstrates how to create dynamic inputs in react and also how to assign refs dynamically in react.

I started writing codes in react and was really feeling myself till I encuntered an interview question that required me to create a form that enabled the user to create input fields on the fly and track each of their values, the last of the inputs gaining focus.

This is exactly what this project solves. All I can say is enjoy!
